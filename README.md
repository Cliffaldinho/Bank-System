# Bank-System

Data is the name of (source code) package.

Inside it stores the servlets, javabeans, and java classes.

Surface level is where html, javascript, jsps are stored.




To install: Place the provided "bankSystem" folder inside your Tomcat directory, in its "webapps" folder.


To log in: To gain full access to system features, use the username "b111" and the password "password". For regular access, use "f111" and "password".


To navigate the main page: "Incidents" displays a list of incidents, "Report" allows you to make a new incident, and "Roles" shows all the current users.


From these pages, all of our use cases listed on our assessment submission sheet are doable. Additionally,
once new users have been created or existing ones have been modified, you will be able to log out of the system
and log in using these new accounts.

Note that some tasks are only available to users with the "branch manager" role, and will require an 
account with such permissions, such as the aforementioned "b111".

Unfortunately, we were unable to integrate incident updating or risk management in time for submission, so once an incident has been made, it can be analyzed, and the staff
assigned to it can be changed, but the actual properties of the incident cannot.
